    <title>For in Loop</title>

<body>
    <p>The <b>for...in</b> loop is used to loop through an object's properties.
        As we have not discussed Objects yet, you may not feel comfortable with this loop.
        But once you understand how objects behave in JavaScript, you will find this loop very useful.</p>
